When implementing custom middleware, it can be useful to be able to store custom context data. This could be to build up a cache or other state data. Hot Chocolate has two types of context data that you can use.

## Global Context Data

The global custom context data is a thread-safe dictionary that is available in the `IQueryContext` and in the `IResolverContext`. This means you are able to share context data between query middleware components and field middleware components.

###Â Query Middleware Example

```csharp
builder.Use(next => context =>
{
    context.ContextData["foo"] = "bar";
    return next.Invoke(context);
});
```

### Field Middleware Example

```csharp
SchemaBuilder.New()
  .Use(next => context =>
  {
      context.ContextData["foo"] = "bar";
      return next.Invoke(context);
  })
  .Create();
```

## Scoped Context Data

The scoped context data dictionary is only available in the `IResolverContext` and is represented by an immutable dictionary. It basically allows you to aggregate state for your sub field resolvers. Let's say you have the following query:

```graphql
{
  a {
    b {
      c
    }
  }
  d {
    e {
      f
    }
  }
}
```

If the `a`-resolver would put something in the scoped context its sub-tree could access that information. This means, `b` and `c` could access the data but not `d`, `e` and `f`.

This is how you store data in the scoped context data:

```csharp
context.ScopedContextData = context.ScopedContextData.SetItem("foo", "bar");
```
