The code first schema approach lets you built your GraphQL schema with .net types and gives you all the goodness of strong types. Moreover, there is no need to switch to the GraphQL syntax in order to specfy your schema. All can be done in your favourite .net language.

Lets walk you through some examples in order to show the various approaches to define a schema.

First let us create our playground project to get started:

```bash
mkdir graphql-demo
cd graphql-demo
dotnet new console  
dotnet add package hotchocolate -v 1.0.0-preview-0012
dotnet restore
```

First we will look at how you can write plain .net objects that can be used to infer GraphQL schema types.

Define a new plain c# class called Query; 

```csharp
public class Query
{
    public string Hello() => "world";
}
```

Now let us create a new schema that uses this type and infers from it the GraphQL query type.

```csharp
Schema.Create(c => c.RegisterType<ObjectType<Query>>());
```

We now have registered an object type with our new schema that is based on our Query class. The schema would look like this:

```graphql
type Query {
    hello: String
}
```

We didn't even have to write resolvers due to the fact that the schema inferred those from the hello function. out hello function is basically our resolver.

But there are some catches here. At the moment we can only infer scalar types like string, int etc..
Furthermore, we can only invere non-nullability from value types. Reference types like System.String will always be inferred as nullable type since all reference types in .net are nullabel.

Fear not, because there is a simple solution to this. If you want to redefine or add more fields to an existing type you can always opt-in to our fluent API to declare your intention.

So, if we wanted the return type of hello to be a non-null string than we could tell our schema that like this.

```csharp
Schema.Create(c => c.RegisterType(new ObjectType<Query>(
    d => d.Field(f => f.Hello()).Type<NonNullType<StringType>>())));
```

Since this fluent chains could get very long you could also opt to declare a new class ObjectType that extends `ObjectType<Query>`.

```csharp
public class QueryType : ObjectType<Query>
{
    protected override void Configure(IObjectTypeDescriptor<Query> descriptor)
    {
        descriptor.Field(f => f.Hello()).Type<NonNullType<StringType>>();
    }
}
```

Also, you can add fields that are not based on your .net poco types.

```csharp
public class QueryType : ObjectType<Query>
{
    protected override void Configure(IObjectTypeDescriptor<Query> descriptor)
    {
        descriptor.Field(f => f.Hello()).Type<NonNullType<StringType>>();
        descriptor.Field("foo").Type<StringType>().Resolver(() => "bar");
    }
}
```

Our new resulting schema woul now look like the following:

```graphql
type Query {
    hello: String!
    foo: String
}
```

The foo field would use the specified delegate to resolve the field value. The fluent api offers you the same feature set as the GraphQL schema syntax.

Next we should look at resolver arguments. GraphQL fields let you define arguments. So, if we adjust our hello method to include a new argument name of type string we would infer from ith the GraphQL field arguments.

```csharp
public class Query
{
    public string Hello(string name) => $"Greetings {name}";
}
```

```graphql
type Query {
    hello(name: String): String
}
```

Also, you can add the [resolver context](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate/blob/master/src/Core/Resolvers/IResolverContext.cs) or any resolver context property as an argument to your method.

```csharp
public class Query
{
    public string Hello(Schema schema, string name) => $"Greetings {name} {schema.Query.Name}";
}
```

```csharp
public class Query
{
    public string Hello(IResolverContext context, string name) => $"Greetings {name} {context.Service<FooService>().GetBar()}";
}
```

This gives you the flexibility to tab into the data that is avilable in the query engine execution context and use it to make your resolvers more dynamic.
