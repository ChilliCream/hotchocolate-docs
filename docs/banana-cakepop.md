_Banana Cake Pop_ is our brand new GraphQL IDE which works well with _Hot Chocolate_ and any other _GraphQL_ server.

_Banana Cake Pop_ is still in preview so try it out and give us feedback via our [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/hotchocolategraphql/shared_invite/enQtNTA4NjA0ODYwOTQ0LTViMzA2MTM4OWYwYjIxYzViYmM0YmZhYjdiNzBjOTg2ZmU1YmMwNDZiYjUyZWZlMzNiMTk1OWUxNWZhMzQwY2Q).

_Banana Cake Pop_ uses 2-phase introspection to tune the IDE to the GraphQL features that are supported by a GraphQL server.

With 2-phase introspection _Banana Cake Pop_ does not limit you to a certain GraphQL spec version but checks for certain features like repeatable directives or subscription support.
